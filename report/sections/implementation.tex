\section{Hardware implementation}
The group was given 2 Pittman 9234 24V motors, the models being 9234S007-R1 and 9234S006, a dual H-bridge and a dSPACE system.
The Pittman 9234S007 is equipped with a rotational encoder.
The dSPACE system is connected to the H-bridge which drives the motors. 
The setup can be seen in figure~\ref{fig:implementation_block}.
Furthermore, the encoders of the motor are connected to the dSPACE system.
A Lecroy wavesurfer 3054 oscilloscope with current probes and KE 34310A multimeters are used in the experiments conducted throughout the report.

The dSPACE system was setup with a low sampling time, $T_s$, in order to avoid oversampling the encoder inputs.
$T_s$ and $f_S$ was choosen to be $\frac{1}{1kHz}$ and $25kHz$, respectively. 
The hardware setup of the encoder input and the PWM output can be seen in figure \ref{fig:encoder} and \ref{fig:pwm}, respectively.
