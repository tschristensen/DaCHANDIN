\section{Implementation}
The group was given 2 Pittmann 9234 24V motors, a dual H-bridge and a dSPACE system. 
One of the Pittmann motors was equipped with rotational encoders.
The dSPACE system is connected to the H-bridge which drives the motors. 
The setup can be seen in figure \ref{fig:implementation_block}.
Furthermore the encoders of the motor is connected to the dSPACE system.
A Lecroy wavesurfer 2054 oscilliscope with current probes and KE 34310A multimeters are used in various experiments.
