\section{Hardware implementation}
The group was given 2 Pittman 9234 24V motors, the models being 9234S007-R1 and 9234S006, a dual H-bridge and a dSPACE system.
The Pittman 9234S007 is equipped with a rotational encoder.
The dSPACE system is connected to the H-bridge which drives the motors. 
The setup can be seen in figure~\ref{fig:implementation_block}.
Furthermore, the encoders of the motor are connected to the dSPACE system.
A Lecroy wavesurfer 3054 oscilloscope with current probes and KE 34310A multimeters are used in the experiments conducted throughout the report.
