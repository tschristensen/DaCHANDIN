\section{Hardware implementation}
The group was given 2 Pittman 9234 24V motors,\todo{Mikkel, check this change. I added the models of the motors.} the models being 9234S007-R1 and 9234S006, a dual H-bridge and a dSPACE system.
One of the Pittman motors was equipped with a rotational encoder.
The dSPACE system is connected to the H-bridge which drives the motors. 
The setup can be seen in figure~\ref{fig:implementation_block}.
Furthermore the encoders of the motor is connected to the dSPACE system.
A Lecroy wavesurfer 2054 oscilloscope with current probes and KE 34310A multimeters are used in the various experiments.
